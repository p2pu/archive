[17:50] <karen> Hi there!
[17:58] <@jorourk4> hi!
[17:58] <@jorourk4> I saw your Tweet
[17:58] <karen> :)
[17:58] <@jorourk4> How are you?
[17:58] <karen> I'm good. You?
[17:58] <@jorourk4> I'm good.  Just finished sending my mission statements
[17:59] <karen> I just saw it -- very clear and focused. I like it.
[17:59] <@jorourk4> Trying to get used to the way this class runs.  I've never taken an online P2P class before!
[17:59] <@jorourk4> Thanks : )
[17:59] <karen> My first time on P2PU too!
[17:59] <@jorourk4> I also posted one for my current company
[18:00] <karen> I took an online course w/one of the founders awhile back.
[18:00] <@jorourk4> I work for the CEO of a software company, and was talking to a colleague in our New Ventures department.  Told him about this class and he suggested that I use this class to help leverage our Marketing -- bc we have no marketing department, lol
[18:01] <karen> LOL... so did your company have a mission statement already in place? If so, did you know about it?
[18:01] <@jorourk4> I've done online courses in college, but they were a little different... most of my info went to my email. so this is definitely a little challenging navigating
[18:01] <@jorourk4> So... I posted our ..... ? statement
[18:01] <@jorourk4> I'm not sure what it is
[18:01] <karen> I just went back and "re-looked" at two of my ventures' mission statements.
[18:01] <@jorourk4> I worked on it, and to be honest, I don't like the entire message
[18:02] <karen> Btw, couldy you send me your email (or post if here if you like)? I'm trying to use email instead of the messaging on P2PU...which I find a little difficult.
[18:03] <@jorourk4> 
[18:03] <@jorourk4> HAPPY for you to email, haha
[18:03] <@jorourk4> I follow my twitter pretty actively... but I def miss a lot
[18:03] <@jorourk4> glad i saw your post though!
[18:03] <karen> Thank you!! Not being able to look at prev msgs is too hard for me. :)
[18:04] <karen> Just posted again... hopefully a few more will join us.
[18:04] <@jorourk4> ok cool : )
[18:04] <karen> I think the synchronous time is hard for folks...were 13 or 14 who posted being available though
[18:04] <@jorourk4> ok, so I think I missed what you meant here
[18:04] <@jorourk4> [17:04] <karen> I just went back and "re-looked" at two of my ventures' mission statements.
[18:05] <karen> I just went back and took a look at two mission statements for companies/projects of my own.
[18:05] <karen> It's good to reevalute periodically.
[18:05] <@jorourk4> ooh i see : )
[18:06] <@jorourk4> Yes, I notice we have some interesting time zones here... will be more challenging
[18:06] <karen> I think it's a challenge to be concrete and focused (like your Bin66 mission) while not ruling out future opportunities
[18:07] <@jorourk4> which are you speaking about?
[18:07] <karen> my companies? K12 Handhelds and the Kids Open Dictionary
[18:08] <@jorourk4> i see
[18:08] <@jorourk4> What did you put as your MS?
[18:08] <@jorourk4> (mission statement)
[18:09] <karen> The mission for the Open Dictionary is "To create a free and open dictionary that is appropriate for kids, both in terms of content and reading level" -- very narrow, but that's really it
[18:09] <karen> K12 Handhelds "provides schools with integrated solutions for mobile technology use in education." This is a business that's changed a lot over almost 10 years.
[18:10] <karen> Mission has gotten broader as a result.
[18:10] <@jorourk4> hmmm
[18:10] <@jorourk4> I would say pick 3 key words out of each that you MUST use
[18:10] <karen> Hi Pam! Glad to see you.
[18:10] <@jorourk4> (3 or 4 main ones)
[18:11] <@jorourk4> Then it's easier to work from there
[18:11] <karen> Good idea, Jen. Forces focus.
[18:11] <pdupuy> HI Karen, hi jorourk4!
[18:11] <karen> Pam, we were just starting to talk about mission statements.
[18:11] <@jorourk4> Hey!  btw you can call me Jennifer or Jo  -- easier then my screen name
[18:11] <pdupuy> I'm gathering that...is there a way to see the chat before coming on?
[18:12] <karen> I thought it was interesting to see how some big company's mission statemts have evolved over time (in the forum posts)
[18:12] <pdupuy> Jo it is
[18:12] <@jorourk4> ;)
[18:12] <karen> Pam, I dont' think so. ..at least as far as I could see.
[18:12] <pdupuy> k'
[18:12] <karen> I'll post a log of the whole thing afterward tho
[18:12] <pdupuy> sorry im' late
[18:13] <karen> No problm. Not sure if others will be joining us; timing is tough for folks I thikn.
[18:13] <pdupuy> I was surprised at stoma of the poor MS by well established co
[18:13] <karen> Funny to see Starbucks mission without the word "coffee"
[18:14] <pdupuy> Good point
[18:14] <karen> Do you think mission statements are more for internal use or extermal use? I think it affects the content.
[18:14] <karen> Bigger company MS's seem to be written for annual reports. :)
[18:14] <pdupuy> I think it CAN be powerful for both groups
[18:15] <@jorourk4> I think it's maybe more internal
[18:15] <karen> I agree.
[18:15] <karen> I think that they should be MANDATORY for internal use...as a way to keep focused and "on message"
[18:15] <pdupuy> I worked at a company where we all learned and used the vision statement within and with customers...it was a powerful intentional kind of mantra for us all, I thought.
[18:15] <karen> I like that... as a mantra.
[18:16] <pdupuy> Got that from GUy Kawasaki
[18:16] <karen> Marketing is communication, and if everyone in an org doesn't know the main "message" it's a problem.
[18:16] <karen> I LOVE Guy K.!!!
[18:16] <karen> I looked at all the marketing books on my bookshelf this weekend and had forgotten how many of Guy's books I have.
[18:16] <pdupuy> HUh? Just saw him for the first time on a youtube vid as I was searching for MSs
[18:17] <pdupuy> WOw
[18:17] <karen> He was the original Apple evangelist...made "evangelism" a marketing mantra.
[18:17] <karen> Now Seth Godin seems to be the big mktg guru.
[18:17] <pdupuy> He was teaching a group at a prestigious co, can't remember who - telling people to forget what they learned about MS!
[18:18] <karen> That sounds like Guy! He's big into "forget what you learned in biz school"
[18:18] <pdupuy> YEah, Iiked his casual down to earth style
[18:18] <karen> Pam, while we're here, do you mind posting your email addr (or you can email it to me if you want)?
[18:18] <pdupuy> Who is Seth Godi?
[18:19] <pdupuy> 
[18:19] <karen> Thanks!
[18:19] <karen> JO, do you know Seth Godin? Many mentioned him as a mktg inspir in their applic for htis course.
[18:20] <@jorourk4> I've heard of him for sure... have to job my brain
[18:20] <karen> I had forgotten he was the second author on some of the old "Guerilla Marketing" books (which I always liked a lot).
[18:20] <karen> http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/
[18:20] <@jorourk4> Yes, checking that out now
[18:20] <karen> I think Permission Marketing is one of his big books.
[18:21] <karen> Tribes too.
[18:21] <@jorourk4> So it's interesting (translated: horrible to admit) -- I've never paid much attention to marketing (GASP!)
[18:21] <pdupuy> I like his home page: "Go Make Something Happen"
[18:21] <@jorourk4> I typically follow entrepreneurs
[18:21] <pdupuy> : ) I avoided marketing like the plague!
[18:21] <karen> Any favorites?
[18:22] <pdupuy> This is very new for me to be interested in marketing...and it is really due to my interest in web stuff
[18:22] <karen> Aren't most entrepreneurs successful marketers (even though they may not call it that)?
[18:22] <karen> I think of marketing as a lot bigger than "advertising" online or offline.
[18:23] <karen> Marketing is communicating a passion. We all do that.
[18:23] <@jorourk4> So my first inspiration was my father.  Not helpful you.  
[18:23] <@jorourk4> Jorn Lyseggen
[18:23] <@jorourk4> He's the owner of the company I'm working at now, and he's a huge inspiration to me
[18:23] <karen> Awesome!
[18:23] <@jorourk4> He's starting a blog: Shack15
[18:23] <karen> Link?
[18:24] <@jorourk4> It launched, and didn't, and then launched... will let you know when there is a Live version for sure!
[18:24] <pdupuy> Jo that's very cool
[18:24] <@jorourk4> We've always been an under the radar company, and just a year ago we started our Communications team
[18:25] <@jorourk4> I was explaining to Karen, we do not have a marketing team -- and although I am taking this class for my own personal knowledge, and trying to help me with Bin86 --- why not take this information and help market the company the pays my bills ; )
[18:25] <pdupuy> Marketing CAN be about communicating a passion
[18:26] <@jorourk4> A fun one: Jessica Mah
[18:26] <@jorourk4> She's the CEO of inDinero
[18:26] <@jorourk4> she's 20?
[18:26] <karen> Interesting question: Is your "passion" evident in your mission statement?
[18:26] <@jorourk4> and owns her own little empire
[18:26] <pdupuy> absolutely
[18:28] <pdupuy> checked out inDinero - looks very cool
[18:29] <@jorourk4> Kevin Rose, Tony Sphere, BizStone, Reid Hoffman, Joi Ito, Raymond Nasr -- also a few fav's of mine
[18:29] <pdupuy> hmmm - well, now that I think about it, it is in the vision statement: "Finding stillness within. Heart. Mind. Body. Soul. World"
[18:29] <@jorourk4> I'm really into the Silicon Valley Tech space and who's who
[18:29] <karen> I know Joi Eto. Interesting guy.
[18:30] <@jorourk4> verrrry interesting
[18:30] <@jorourk4> I met him in November
[18:30] <karen> Pam, good passion in that statement...could apply to a lot of things though, no?
[18:30] <@jorourk4> If something seems like 'the right thing' ... he'll say 'do the opposite'
[18:30] <@jorourk4> Love it!
[18:30] <pdupuy> : ) so much to learn in this new world of marketing and entrepreneurship
[18:31] <@jorourk4> I would say, Pam, same thing (not sure if you entered convo when mentioned) -- but pick 3-4 main key words you DEF want in your mission statement
[18:31] <karen> I think we were talking right b4 you came on about the challenge of being clear and specific while not limiting possible opportunities
[18:31] <@jorourk4> then we can work from there
[18:32] <pdupuy> Yes, Karen - agree it could apply to a lot of things - the mission statement is very specific. Will paste in a moment
[18:32] <@jorourk4> Just like Guy was saying in youtube video -- Wendys statement is blah blah blah - but it should be this: Healthy Fast Food.  Boom!
[18:32] <pdupuy> We bring together people seeking retreats, with retreat centers and retreat leaders through our beautiful, intelligent, user friendly, and comprehensive worldwide web-based directory.
[18:32] <karen> Hard to combine "visionary" with "specific" sometimes.
[18:32] <karen> Yes, much more specific.
[18:33] <pdupuy> Yes, I do really like the "Healthy Fast Food" type...just not there yet!
[18:33] <karen> Retreats are obviously a key. COuld you see yourself doing something other than retreats in the mid-term future?
[18:34] <pdupuy> sure
[18:34] <pdupuy> I'm involved with several things - the retreat directory is just one
[18:34] <@jorourk4> Pam, I think you'd be solid with just: Our Directory brings together people seeking retreat related .... (can't think of last word)
[18:34] <karen> Is there a way to describe the "retreat" idea that is a little less specific but still gets at your core?
[18:35] <karen> mission = why you exist
[18:35] <pdupuy> hmmm stillness captures it for me but not sure how much it does for others
[18:36] <pdupuy> Jo - hmm I like beginning with directory...
[18:36] <karen> Stillness could be a lot of things...I think....
[18:37] <pdupuy> I exist to connect people seeking retreats, all kinds, for healing and spiritual growth...with all the opps out there...
[18:37] <karen> I really like the word "connect".... it covers the directory idea but could be more.
[18:37] <pdupuy> but our inspiration was to make it an aesthetically beautiful experience - a little like going on a retreat while at the site - and really helpful...
[18:38] <pdupuy> yes, i lke connect, too a dabbled with it earlier
[18:38] <@jorourk4> sorry-- doing this form my office and ppl are popping in and out....
[18:38] <pdupuy> appreciate the attention on this from y'll
[18:38] <karen> I am in the middle of a social media project w/a client and we're calling our evangelists "connectors"
[18:38] <karen> "Are you a connector?"
[18:38] <@jorourk4> I see more of what you mean though... let me think
[18:39] <pdupuy> : )
[18:39] <@jorourk4> I feel like when you have a MS -- that it should be clear. So clear that a 7 year old could wrap it's head around what you do.
[18:39] <pdupuy> karen - what do you mean by that?
[18:40] <@jorourk4> If you can convince a 7 year old what you do -- millions of other people will also get it
[18:40] <karen> Picking up on JO's idea  "...retreats and related experiences to foster stillness and reflection"
[18:41] <pdupuy> hmm - well I am separating an MS from a vision statement...but I sooo agree with making it alive and accessible...
[18:41] <karen> Sometimes I have a hard time separating mission and vision.
[18:42] <@jorourk4> Define "MS" Define "VS"
[18:42] <pdupuy> Karen...that seems stiff, though, "related experiences" and "foster"... but appreciate so much the attention to this
[18:42] <@jorourk4> Pam- do you have a website I can see?
[18:42] <pdupuy> MS - to me describes what you are doing...VS communicates the passion, somehow
[18:43] <@jorourk4> ahh, ok I see
[18:43] <pdupuy> stillmountainretreatguide.com
[18:43] <@jorourk4> K- would you agree?
[18:43] <karen> For myself, I often have a mission statement that is primarily for internal purposes (to focus the team) and then messaging that is externally focused...more friendly, accessible, etc.
[18:43] <karen> Yes, I think mission is what you are .... and vision is more future-focused, what you want to be ?
[18:43] <pdupuy> yes...i like that...
[18:44] <@jorourk4> ok, gonna check out site and see what i gather form it
[18:44] <@jorourk4> P- are you looking for MS or VS more?
[18:44] <karen> Beatiful site, P.
[18:45] <karen> "Committed to providing resources and guidance for people seeking spiritual retreats—helping individuals, adolescents, couples, and families find the retreat, workshop, or healing modality that best meets their need"
[18:45] <pdupuy> thanks - thanks - feels rather baroque, now LOL, to me but still good. Not user friendly enough, yet
[18:45] <karen> Clear...says retreat but also more
[18:46] <karen> Funny to see yoga there because when you posted your mission, yoga is exactly what I thought of.
[18:47] <@jorourk4> I think what K posted is perfect!
[18:47] <pdupuy> yoga and meditation are typical, but there is so much out there... a world of pilgrimages t places like Iran or the Sahara
[18:47] <@jorourk4> Right there from your site...!
[18:47] <pdupuy> monasteries I spent a month at a traditional benedictine that was incredible for me...vision quests, etc
[18:47] <karen> (except I was thinking of it in my yoga room rather than at a retreat :)
[18:48] <pdupuy> do you have your own yoga room?
[18:49] <pdupuy> Jo - u asked if i wanted more of a vs than an ms...I think I need both, and honed...people are contacting me to partner with, teaching me who my customers are...
[18:49] <karen> Ha...just built phase 1 of a new house w/a yoga room...except it's doubling as a sitting room until phase 2 is done!
[18:50] <pdupuy> very nice!
[18:50] <pdupuy> we have a meditation room : )
[18:50] <karen> Interesting... that makes me think that your mission can guide your vision! e.g. do new opportuntiies support your mission?
[18:50] <karen> Not jumping on every opportunity is a problem I have.
[18:50] <pdupuy> JO - yes, the intro on the first page that K pasted in was what we first wrote together...just feels...not alive enough!
[18:51] <pdupuy> K- yes!
[18:51] <@jorourk4> Hmmm
[18:52] <pdupuy> I got feedback from an Eben Pagan coach saygin I am too broad and have to narrow my niche...at least to identify the "customer avatars" new phrase for me and address them one at a time...kinda - at least in terms of driving traffic
[18:52] <@jorourk4> So describe to me in laymens terms what you do, Pam
[18:53] <karen> this might sound silly but taking out the word "website" in that sentence makes it sound more alive to me.
[18:53] <@jorourk4> I see the site.  But if you could only give me one sentence.  What would it be : )
[18:53] <karen> You're more than a "website" -- you're people, connections, resources, etc.
[18:54] <karen> Googling "customer avatars" ...new to me.
[18:54] <@jorourk4> I agree w Karen
[18:55] <karen> I take it that identifying customer avatars means knowing your customers?
[18:55] <pdupuy> OK - Still Mountain connects people with retreats, retreat resources, powerful, transformative, life changing experiences...through our website...
[18:55] <@jorourk4> I think that is what I'm trying to gather from you Pam -- are you a social network where people can speak together?  are you the go to person for people to go to?  Are you a place where people come to?
[18:55] <pdupuy> that is a new idea - that we are more than a website...but you are right...
[18:56] <@jorourk4> Are you available to speak with?  Like a center?  Or a place where I go for information?
[18:56] <pdupuy> customer avatar is kind of like a specific typical customer - married woman without children in her 40s, say (At least from context that is what I gathered.)
[18:57] <karen> got it
[18:57] <karen> I think you are more than a website and that seems more appealing to me. Do you currently use other tools to "do your mission"? Like social media, newsletters, etc.?
[18:57] <pdupuy> it is a website, mainly, though I ma available for consultation...not that that is a focus right now
[18:58] <karen> Hmm....lots to chew on
[18:58] <karen> Great conversation....b4 our time is up... any suggestions for the course? or other questions?
[18:58] <@jorourk4> Eben Pagan -- prob a nice person.  Not sure who it is...but I agree w what he said.  Make sure you have a niche place in the market.  I think you should speak w your partner and find out "who" specifically you want to focus on... build a community there.  It will be so much easier for you to be the one and only go to place for a specific niche -- then trying to dominate the entire market.  
[18:58] <karen> Are you interested in future chats or other synchronous discussions?
[18:59] <pdupuy> just launched a newsletter - you can see link at bottom of home page...let people know about it in Facebook and twitter but need to start advertising - list is close to 1000 right now...we received 1700 visits last month...
[18:59] <karen> So you *are* more than a website! ;)
[18:59] <@jorourk4> Karen-- I like the chats bc there is more interaction
[19:00] <karen> Appreciate the feedback....and thx for being here, both of you.
[19:00] <pdupuy> I appreciate it much - hope we didn't' focus too much on my site, thouhg
[19:00] <@jorourk4> Pam -- I have an interesting company in the bay area happy to connect you with, to help build your fan base etc
[19:00] <karen> Pam, not at all. Made me think about things differently. Esp the connection of mission and vision in evaluating opportunities.
[19:00] <pdupuy> cool jo - be glad for any and all guidance, support
[19:00] <@jorourk4> yeah i agree
[19:01] <@jorourk4> I think Skype could be a great option for us too?
[19:01] <@jorourk4> Skype launched group calling today -- not sure if there is a cost involved w that
[19:01] <@jorourk4> but could prove to be more effective w time?
[19:01] <@jorourk4> in the future
[19:01] <karen> We could definitely do Skype. Chat,? Voice? Vid? I think you can do small groups for free.
[19:01] <pdupuy> sure! I am "stillwild"
[19:01] <@jorourk4> my skype handle: jenniferkorourke
[19:01] <pdupuy> will it do group for mac - thought it was only PC
[19:01] <karen> Would depend how many people wanted to.
[19:02] <@jorourk4> yes- mac launched today
[19:02] <pdupuy> yeah!!!!
[19:02] <karen> I'm kfasimpaur on most everything...but I generally am only on skype "by appt."
[19:02] <@jorourk4> (tech news nerd, here!)
[19:02] <@jorourk4> lol
[19:02] <pdupuy> LOL
[19:02] <pdupuy> how many people?
[19:02] <@jorourk4> ok cool.  we can see what other peers say and set up accordingly
[19:03] <@jorourk4> don't have that answer
[19:03] <pdupuy> k
[19:03] <@jorourk4> sorry if I let you down
[19:03] <@jorourk4> haha
[19:03] <pdupuy> LOL
[19:03] <karen> You can research it and get back to us? I've only done it with a couple others.
[19:03] <karen> :)
[19:03] <@jorourk4> suuure
[19:04] <@jorourk4> I think we'd have to do specific call times though
[19:04] <pdupuy> i Skype solo all the time and have tried the mac a few times with more than 1
[19:04] <karen> I will say that i think sync voice is tough with more than a group of 5 or 6
[19:04] <@jorourk4> say 5 ppl at 5pm PST, 5 ppl at 7pm PST --- for example
[19:04] <@jorourk4> bc we can't have much more than that on a call
[19:04] <karen> I'm itching to try Big Blue Button but haven't yet
[19:04] <@jorourk4> exactly- haha we're on same page
[19:04] <pdupuy> : )
[19:05] <pdupuy> shall we try it now for a se ?
[19:05] <@jorourk4> Sure.
[19:05] <pdupuy> do we need to download the new version?
[19:05] <karen> Sure. Will need a sec to hook up. JO, will you initiate call?
[19:06] <@jorourk4> sure.. let me know when you guys are ready
[19:06] <pdupuy> ready - on
[19:06] <@jorourk4> i DL new version today -- not sure if you have to or not
[19:07] <karen> OK, I've approved you as a contact and I'm on, I think.
[19:08] <karen> I can hear you but u obviously can't hear me.
[19:10] <@jorourk4> hmmm
[19:10] <karen> Well, nice to hear you anyway!
[19:10] <@jorourk4> hehe
[19:10] <@jorourk4> now we know
[19:10] <pdupuy> :)
[19:10] <@jorourk4> will have to read up on that one
[19:10] <@jorourk4> well.. have a good night to each of you
[19:11] <@jorourk4> will be online (skype) if anyone wants to spar any further
[19:11] <pdupuy> same to you both!
[19:11] <karen> Thx again you guys! Have a good one.
